## Decision Made
| # | Area  | Decision      | Alternative        | Rationale
| ----------- | ----------- |---------------|--------------------|--- |
| 1 | IDE | Use Intellij  | VSCode, Eclipse    | Language independent editor so that it can be used in non java course
| 2 | Dependency Management  | Maven         | Gradle             | Not a fan of XML bloat
| 3 | Code  | Lombok        | Code template code | We have done too many template code and so don't need to learn that
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml          | Properties         | Easier to view groups of configuration and it is different than what we learned in other classes with property files and so using this opporutnity to learn something different
